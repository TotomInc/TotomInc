### Hello 👋

I'm a front-end enginner who is passionate about making open-source more accessible!

Some technologies I enjoy working with (daily) include Vue, React and Jamstack stuff (Gatsby/Next/Nuxt). NodeJS, TypeScript, Mongo/MySQL and a bit of Java for anything related to back-end.

I'm always willing to learn new technologies after many years in the development field and don't hesitate to help newcomers! 🙂
