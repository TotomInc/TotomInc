### Hello 👋

I'm a front-end enginner who is passionate about making open-source more accessible!

Some technologies I enjoy working with (daily) include Vue, React and Jamstack stuff (Gatsby/Next/Nuxt) because I'm a fan of headless CMSes (prismic.io and Strapi).

NodeJS + TypeScript, Mongo and MySQL, WordPress and a bit of Java are languages I use for anything related to a back-end.

I'm always willing to learn new technologies after many years in the development field and don't hesitate to help newcomers!
